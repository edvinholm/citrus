We can read the whole packet in, and put it in a buffer where we always put the last
received packet in.
Then, we can interpret that data like Read(u64, id) etc.
And if there are strings, we set str.length to first 4 bytes, and then data to the next byte after that.
No need to allocate every string.
(Why did I not think of this before? Because I'm stupid.)


get_next_ucb_packet();


// Do one of these for every implementation of a User Client
room_server_user_client_loop()
{
	while(true)
	{
		UCB_Packet packet;
		if(get_next_ucb_packet(&packet)) {
			switch(packet.type) {

			}
		}
	}
}

// And then we have:
get_next_rcb_packet();

// And other stuff like
connect_to_user_server(User_ID user, Socket *_socket);
disconnect_from_user_server(Socket *socket);

perform_user_server_transaction(USB_Transaction transaction, Socket *socket);
// etc.
